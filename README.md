## My process

- Set up my work environment.
- Format the html file.
- Add the fonts.
- Style the document to match the design.
- Add media queries to make the page responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design

### What I learned

Positioning the footer element when the content was overlapping it. The absolute position property positioned the footer element at the bottom of the viewport, which overlapped with the rest of the page. My solution was to create a second attribution element that would be visible on smaller screens.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18990675/how-to-fix-a-footer-overlapping-content) - This helped me to figure out how to position the footer element at the botom of the screen.
